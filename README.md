# Design
## Design Choices
I wanted to make the website feel a bit old fashioned with colors of blue representing part of the Frencg flag. It needs to feel antique and old so that the user can feel like they are going back in time.

## Colour
For the colour sheme warm brown tones were chosen to match the images on the page and also the colour theme of the actual restaurant. To narrow down the colours I used Adobe Color. After deciding on the colour I tested them on WebAIM to make sure the contrast between them was right.

## Fonts
Pinyon script with cursive as fallback was used for the logo to match the sign outside the restaurant.
Montserrat was used for the body and Roboto for headings. Both fonts are considered dyslexia friendly.

## Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the restaurant logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. The website consists of five separate pages:

A homepage with a sections for News and Sunday Meal Offers
An about page with the About Us and Meet the Chef
A menu page
A image gallery with images and video showcasing the general feel of the restaurant
A contact page with a contact form, a map and information about the bussines section
