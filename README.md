# Design
## Design Choices
I wanted to make the website feel a bit old fashioned with colors of blue representing part of the French flag. It needs to feel antique and old so that the user can feel like they are going back in time.

## Fonts
I used the lora font for my page as it looks like ancient writing and makes the website have the more historical feel to it.

## Structure
The website is structured so that the user can slowly build from no information about Napoleon to knowing a good amount of knowledge. It starts with a brief descriptipon on the homepage and links to the other pages and what they have to offer. Here are the 4 main pages that the website has:

- An easy to understand and use nav bar
- A home page that gives a brief description of Napoleon
