        <h1>Siege of Toulon</h1>
        <p>The Siege of Toulon happened in 1793 and was Napoloens first victory in his miliary carrer. It was fought between Republican forces and Royalist rebels during the French Revolution. It was this battle in which Napoleon made his mark and gained reputation as being an excellent commander. His strategy to recapture key naval bases at Toulon led to the siege swinging in the French Republics favour which allowed them to challenge the British navy and start to recapture the city.</p>
