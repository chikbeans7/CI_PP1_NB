                <p>Born on the 15th of August 1769 in Ajaccio, Corisca which had recently became a part of the Kingdom of France at this time. Carlo Buonaparte was his father and he was a lawyer married to his mother named Letizia Ramolino. He was moved to France and started his education there from the age of 9 and struggled with feeling like a foreigner as he did not hold the same traditions as his fellow French man.</p>
